# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_PCOS_ANALYSIS

As part of my analysis of healthcare data, I conducted a detailed evaluation of diagnostic indicators in women using the PCOS_CLASSIFICATION dataset. The dataset was analyzed to identify clinical patterns, hormonal imbalances, and lifestyle factors contributing to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were applied for classification, with Random Forest achieving the best accuracy. The study revealed that BMI, age, hormone levels, and lifestyle habits were key predictors of PCOS. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in medical data analysis, feature-based classification, and predictive healthcare modeling.
